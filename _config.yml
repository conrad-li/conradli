about: 
  "I am a software engineer at Bank of America in New York, NY. I graduated in 2021 from Bowdoin College with a major in Computer Science and a minor in Sociology (and Economics, informally). I am interested in the intersection between tech and education, specifically providing opportunities for first-gen college students like myself. 

  <br><br>

  For summer 2020, I was a Global Tech Analyst at Bank of America where my team delivered the top three time series prediction models for daily ATM volume estimations out of all intern groups.

  <br><br>
  
  <b>At this time, I am not looking for a job, but I am open to new opportunities! I am interested in exploring product management and software engineer.</b> I have experience with Python, Java, C++, Kotlin, HTML, CSS/SASS, JS, machine learning models, agile development, and a willingness to learn."
